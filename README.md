# denote-fzf-lua

Neovim plugin that uses `fzf-lua` to search a directory of notes formatted with the Emacs Denote file-naming scheme:

`DATE==SIGNATURE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXTENSION`

The nice custom table for Denote files is the only unique 'feature' of this plugin. If you don't care about that you should use your existing search plugin.
